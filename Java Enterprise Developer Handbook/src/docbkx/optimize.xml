  <title>Optimizing Performance</title>

  <para>
  	This chapter will focus on common performance issues and how to resolve them from the perspective of
  	a Java programmer. The performance issues relating to design is out of scope of this chapter and will not be
  	discussed.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>In most of the cases, maintainability should be more important than performance. Between an algorithm
      which is a little slow but is easy to understand and an algorithm which executes faster but is hard to understand,
      you should choose the later. We should choose the former only when the performance is unacceptable to the users.

      The indicator of a low-performance web application is often a slow loading page. To understand the cause of
      slow pages, you can use <link xlink:href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">Yahoo! YSlow</link>. A screenshot
      of Yahoo! YSlow is below.
